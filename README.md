# cs50xfinalproject


# I took the multiplayer default project from Yuri Sarudiansky's multiplayer model and made a bunch of modifications to adapt for my project and needs;

the music I took from https://devdevious.itch.io/grassroots;

shot effect I took from: https://jdwasabi.itch.io/8-bit-16-bit-sound-effects-pack

all my files are free and should remain that; feel free to use with your own project. 


if you are going to use any of the third party files, give them credit as well
