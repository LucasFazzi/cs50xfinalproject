# cs50xfinalproject


# I took the multiplayer default project from Yuri Sarudiansky's\
# multiplayer model and made a bunch of modifications to adapt\
# for my project and needs;

# the music I took from https://devdevious.itch.io/grassroots;
# shot effect I took from: https://jdwasabi.itch.io/8-bit-16-bit-sound-effects-pack

# all the files are free and should remain that; feel free to use\
# with your own project.
